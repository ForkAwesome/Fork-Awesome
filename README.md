# Fork Awesome

_A fork of the iconic font and CSS toolkit, Font Awesome_

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project has not had a release for ~2 years, and another release is not planned. Rather, this project will be archived by mid 2024 unless someone else takes over maintenance. This is because:**

> The driving force for forking‚Äîto have a community run icon set‚Äîhas not been realized. The site and font build processes are broken. The source icon files need to be reworked or remade. The project focuses on icon fonts, despite icon fonts as a technology being outdated. Many other free icon sets now exist.

People interested in taking over maintenance can write in the [matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#forkawesome:matrix.org), mention me (`@douginamug`) in an issue or write to me on on [mastodon](https://mastodon.xyz/@douginamug).** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Fork Awesome is a suite of 796 pictographic and brand icons for easy, scalable vector graphics on websites and beyond.**

This project began as a fork of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com). Font Awesome was originally created by [Dave Gandy](https://twitter.com/davegandy) and ran as a community project. However, as Font Awesome developed, pull requests from the community stopped being accepted (October 2016) and as of version 5.0 [the build system became private](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/12199#issuecomment-362919956) (February 2018).

With gratitude to Dave Gandy and the Font Awesome team, [Julien Deswaef](https://merveilles.town/@xuv) forked Font Awesome 4.7 into [Fork Awesome 1.0](https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome/releases/tag/1.0.0) in February 2018, to continue building the amazing resource in a fully free, libre and open-source fashion, with and for the wider community. After a period of extended inactivity (i.e. no release since February 2019), several Fork Awesome users [got](https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome/issues/292) [together](https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome/issues/235) to try and revive the project üå±

We are ~~now catching up with backlogged issues and pull requests, updating technology and documentation ‚Äî even~~ reevaluating the project aims, as icon fonts gradually [become](https://www.irigoyen.dev/blog/2021/02/17/stop-using-icon-fonts/) [deprecated](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/seriously-dont-use-icon-fonts/). Come say hi in the [#forkawesome:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#forkawesome:matrix.org) matrix room üôÇ

- Big changes, without breaking backward compatibility, bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
- Bug fixes, small adaptations, adding a few icons and misc changes bumps the patch
- The fork started from FontAwesome 4.7 (last commit by Dave is [bdfa9823](https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome/commits/master?after=b0bc8f6fb74e05c987ef7ce1525cd3ab8390a1c3+69)).
